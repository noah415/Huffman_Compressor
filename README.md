# Huffman_Compressor
This is a Python class that uses a Huffman Tree algorithm to compress and decompress a text file. I did not include all of the test .txt files in this repository (so unittests will throw a FileNotFound Error); however, for example of the output files from the compression and decompression methods you can look at the file1.txt files I put in this repository.

# What I used
